# End-To-End-ML-Project
This project demonstrates the construction of a complete, end-to-end machine learning system engineered to predict California housing prices. Using the canonical California Housing dataset, it encapsulates the entire ML lifecycle—from raw data ingestion to a deployment-ready packaged model—while adhering to production-grade engineering standards.
